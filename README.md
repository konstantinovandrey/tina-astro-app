Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name which are generated from the content under `src/content/` (excluding the `config` folder). 

**To enable Visual Editing with TinaCMS we have had to use React components and a new `client:tina` Directive. Which is the code located under `astro-tina-directive`. **

Under the `tina/` folder we have, `collections/` which holds our TinaCMS schema definitions. Under `components/` we have a custom Icon Component that is used within the TinaCMS UI. Under `pages/` we have the "wrappers" that make the Visual Editing work, using the `useTina` hook. 

The `pages/index.astro` is the "Home" page - This is a special case and has been setup to look for the `content/page/home.mdx` file. 

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.
